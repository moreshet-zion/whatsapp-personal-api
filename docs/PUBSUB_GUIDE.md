## Overview

The pub/sub system provides:

- **Topic Management**: Create topics for different types of content
- **Subscriber Management**: Add/remove phone numbers from topics
- **Message Broadcasting**: Send messages to all topic subscribers
- **Delivery Tracking**: See which messages were delivered successfully
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delay between messages to avoid spam
- **Subscription Tracking**: See which topics a number is subscribed to

---

## Core Concepts

### Topics
A **topic** is a named category for messages. Examples:
- `daily-updates` - Daily team updates
- `family-news` - Family announcements  
- `product-launches` - Product release notifications
- `emergency-alerts` - Urgent notifications

### Subscribers
**Subscribers** are phone numbers that receive messages from topics they're subscribed to.

### Publishing
**Publishing** means sending a message to all subscribers of a specific topic.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Topic

```bash
export API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Create a topic for daily updates
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "daily-updates",
    "description": "Daily status updates for the team"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Topic created",
  "topic": {
    "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "name": "daily-updates",
    "description": "Daily status updates for the team",
    "subscribers": [],
    "created": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Important**: Save the topic `id` - you'll need it for subsequent operations.

### 2. Add Subscribers

```bash
# Add subscribers to your topic
export TOPIC_ID="123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"

# Add first subscriber
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID/subscribers" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "number": "1234567890"
  }'

# Add second subscriber
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID/subscribers" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "number": "0987654321"
  }'
```

### 3. Publish Your First Message

```bash
# Broadcast a message to all subscribers
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/pubsub/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "topicId": "'$TOPIC_ID'",
    "message": "Hello everyone! This is our first broadcast message üì¢"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Message broadcast completed",
  "summary": {
    "topic": { /* topic details */ },
    "attempted": 2,
    "delivered": 2,
    "results": [
      {
        "number": "1234567890",
        "success": true
      },
      {
        "number": "0987654321", 
        "success": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Managing Topics

### List All Topics

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics
```

### Get Topic Details

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID"
```

### Delete a Topic

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è This permanently deletes the topic and all its subscribers
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY"
```

### Topic Naming Best Practices

- Use **kebab-case**: `daily-updates` not `Daily Updates`
- Be **descriptive**: `product-launches` not `news`
- Keep it **short**: `team-alerts` not `team-emergency-alert-system`
- Avoid **spaces**: Use hyphens or underscores

---

## Managing Subscribers

### View Subscribers for a Topic

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID/subscribers"
```

### Subscribe a Phone Number

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID/subscribers" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "number": "5551234567"
  }'
```

**Phone Number Formats**: The system accepts various formats but normalizes them:
- `+1-234-567-8900` ‚Üí `1234567890`
- `(234) 567-8900` ‚Üí `2345678900`
- `234-567-8900` ‚Üí `2345678900`

curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics/$TOPIC_ID/subscribers" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "number": "5551234567"
  }'
```

### Check Subscriptions for a Number

```bash
# See which topics a number is subscribed to
curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:3000/pubsub/subscriptions/1234567890"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "subscription": {
    "number": "1234567890",
    "normalized": "1234567890",
    "topics": [
      {
        "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "name": "daily-updates"
      },
      {
        "id": "456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111",
        "name": "emergency-alerts"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Publishing Messages

### Basic Publishing

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/pubsub/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "topicId": "'$TOPIC_ID'",
    "message": "Weekly team update: All projects are on track! üëç"
  }'
```

### Understanding Delivery Results

The publish response includes detailed delivery information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Message broadcast completed",
  "summary": {
    "topic": {
      "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "name": "daily-updates"
    },
    "attempted": 3,    // Total subscribers
    "delivered": 2,    // Successful deliveries
    "results": [
      {
        "number": "1234567890",
        "success": true
      },
      {
        "number": "0987654321",
        "success": true  
      },
      {
        "number": "5555555555",
        "success": false,
        "error": "Failed to send message"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Message Formatting Tips

**Emojis**: Use emojis to make messages more engaging
```json
{
  "message": "üö® Emergency Alert: Office is closed today due to weather ‚ùÑÔ∏è"
}
```

**Line Breaks**: Use `\n` for line breaks
```json
{
  "message": "Daily Update:\n\n‚úÖ Project A completed\nüîÑ Project B in progress\nüìÖ Meeting at 3 PM"
}
```

**Links**: WhatsApp will automatically format URLs
```json
{
  "message": "Check out our new blog post: https://example.com/blog/updates"
}
```

---

## Settings and Configuration

### View Current Settings

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" http://localhost:3000/pubsub/settings
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "settings": {
    "messageDelaySeconds": 1
  }
}
```

### Update Settings

```bash
# Set 2-second delay between messages
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/pubsub/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messageDelaySeconds": 2
  }'
```

### Why Message Delay Matters

- **Rate Limiting**: WhatsApp has limits on message frequency
- **Spam Prevention**: Delays make broadcasts look more natural
- **Reliability**: Reduces chance of connection issues
- **Politeness**: Avoids overwhelming recipients

**Recommended Settings**:
- **Small groups** (< 10 subscribers): 1 second
- **Medium groups** (10-50 subscribers): 2-3 seconds  
- **Large groups** (50+ subscribers): 3-5 seconds

## Best Practices

### Topic Organization

1. **Keep Topics Focused**
   - ‚úÖ Good: `product-updates`, `team-social`, `emergency-alerts`
   - ‚ùå Bad: `general-stuff`, `misc`, `everything`

2. **Use Descriptive Names**
   - ‚úÖ Good: `weekly-sales-reports`
   - ‚ùå Bad: `reports`

3. **Plan Topic Hierarchy**
   ```
   company-all          # Company-wide announcements
   engineering-team     # Engineering team updates  
   engineering-alerts   # Engineering emergency alerts
   product-launches     # Product launch notifications
   ```

### Subscriber Management

1. **Get Consent**: Only subscribe people who opted in
2. **Provide Unsubscribe**: Make it easy for people to opt out
3. **Clean Up**: Regularly remove inactive numbers
4. **Test First**: Always test with a small group

### Message Quality

1. **Be Clear and Concise**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Good: "Meeting moved to 3 PM today - Conference Room B"
   ‚ùå Bad: "Hey everyone, just wanted to let you know that the meeting we had scheduled for 2 PM has been moved to 3 PM due to a conflict with another meeting. New location is Conference Room B on the 5th floor."
   ```

2. **Use Appropriate Frequency**
   - Daily updates: Once per day maximum
   - Weekly updates: 1-2 times per week
   - Emergency alerts: Only when truly urgent

3. **Add Context**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Good: "[Team Update] Project Alpha completed ahead of schedule üéâ"
   ‚ùå Bad: "It's done"
   ```

### Error Handling

Always check the delivery results:

```bash
# Example of handling failed deliveries
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/pubsub/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"topicId":"'$TOPIC_ID'","message":"Test"}')

echo "$RESPONSE" | jq '.summary.delivered'  # Count of successful deliveries
echo "$RESPONSE" | jq '.summary.results[] | select(.success == false)'  # Failed deliveries
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Publishing Fails**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "WhatsApp not connected"
}
```
**Solution**: Check WhatsApp connection status at `/health` endpoint.

**2. Some Messages Not Delivered**
Check the delivery results in the publish response:
```json
{
  "number": "1234567890",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to send message"
}
```
**Possible causes**:
- Number is not on WhatsApp
- Number has blocked you
- WhatsApp rate limiting
- Temporary connection issues

**3. Topic Not Found**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Topic not found"
}
```
**Solution**: Verify the topic ID is correct by listing all topics.

**4. Subscriber Already Exists**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Already subscribed"
}
```
**Note**: This is not an error - the system prevents duplicate subscriptions.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Health First**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```

2. **List All Topics**
   ```bash
   curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" http://localhost:3000/pubsub/topics
   ```

3. **Test with Small Groups**
   Start with 1-2 subscribers before adding more.

4. **Monitor Delivery Results**
   Always check the `results` array in publish responses.

5. **Check Phone Number Format**
   Use the subscription status endpoint to see the normalized format.

### Rate Limiting Issues

If you're experiencing delivery failures:

1. **Increase Message Delay**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/pubsub/settings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
     -d '{"messageDelaySeconds": 5}'
   ```

2. **Split Large Topics**
   Instead of one topic with 100 subscribers, create multiple smaller topics.

3. **Test Delivery Times**
   Monitor how long broadcasts take and adjust accordingly.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Combining with Scheduled Messages

You can combine pub/sub with scheduled messages for automated broadcasts:

```bash
# Schedule a daily morning update
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scheduled \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jid": "trigger@automation.local",
    "message": "trigger-daily-update",
    "schedule": "0 8 * * *",
    "description": "Trigger daily pub/sub update"
  }'
```

Then use a webhook or external system to listen for this trigger and call the pub/sub API.

### Integration with External Systems

The pub/sub API works great with:
- **Zapier/IFTTT**: Trigger broadcasts from other apps
- **GitHub Actions**: Send deployment notifications
- **Monitoring Tools**: Alert teams about system issues
- **CRM Systems**: Send customer update broadcasts
- **Calendar Apps**: Send meeting reminders to teams

This completes the pub/sub system guide. The pub/sub feature provides a powerful way to manage communication with multiple recipients while maintaining control over delivery timing and tracking results.
