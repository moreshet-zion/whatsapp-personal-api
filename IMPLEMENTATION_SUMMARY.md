- ✅ Automatic database initialization with default settings

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components Built:

1. **Database Service** (`src/models/database.ts`)
   - JSON-based data storage
   - Full CRUD operations for all entities
   - Data integrity and relationships

2. **Pub/Sub Service** (`src/services/pubsub.ts`)
   - Core pub/sub logic
   - Message queue processing
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - WhatsApp integration

3. **API Endpoints** (`src/server.ts`)
   - Complete REST API for all operations
   - Input validation with Zod
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **WhatsApp Integration** (Extended existing)
   - Baileys-based WhatsApp client
   - Connection management
   - Message sending with rate limiting

## 📊 API Endpoints Implemented

### Topic Management
- `POST /topics` - Create topic
- `GET /topics` - List topics
- `GET /topics/:id` - Get topic details
- `PUT /topics/:id` - Update topic
- `DELETE /topics/:id` - Delete topic
- `GET /topics/:id/subscribers` - Get topic subscribers

### Subscription Management
- `POST /subscribe` - Subscribe to topic
- `POST /unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from topic
- `GET /subscription-status/:phoneNumber/:topicId` - Check subscription

### Subscriber Management
- `GET /subscribers` - List all subscribers
- `GET /subscribers/:phoneNumber` - Get subscriber details
- `GET /subscribers/:phoneNumber/topics` - Get subscriber's topics
- `PUT /subscribers/:phoneNumber` - Update subscriber
- `DELETE /subscribers/:phoneNumber` - Delete subscriber

### Message Publishing

- `PUT /settings` - Update setting

### System Management
- `GET /health` - System health (enhanced with pub/sub stats)
- `GET /queue-status` - Message queue status
- `POST /cleanup-messages` - Clean old messages

## 🔧 Rate Limiting Implementation

The system implements sophisticated rate limiting to prevent WhatsApp spam detection:

### Configurable Settings:
- **message_delay_seconds**: Delay between individual message sends (default: 5s)
- **max_retry_attempts**: Maximum retry attempts for failed messages (default: 3)
- **queue_process_interval**: How often to process the message queue (default: 10s)

### Rate Limiting Strategy:
1. Messages are queued when published
2. Queue processor runs at configured intervals
3. Messages are sent with configurable delays between each recipient
4. Failed messages are retried with exponential backoff
5. WhatsApp connection status is monitored before sending

### Recommended Settings by Volume:
- **Low volume** (< 100 msgs/day): 5s delay, 3 retries
- **Medium volume** (100-1000 msgs/day): 10s delay, 2 retries  
- **High volume** (1000+ msgs/day): 15-30s delay, 2 retries

## 📁 Data Structure

The system stores data in JSON format for easy management:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "topic-name",
      "description": "Topic description",
      "created": "ISO-timestamp",
      "updated": "ISO-timestamp", 
      "active": true
    }
  ],
  "subscribers": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
      "name": "Optional name",
      "created": "ISO-timestamp",
      "active": true
    }
  ],
  "subscriptions": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "topicId": "topic-uuid",
      "subscriberId": "subscriber-uuid",
      "created": "ISO-timestamp",
      "active": true
    }
  ],
  "messageQueue": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "topicId": "topic-uuid",
      "message": "Message content",
      "scheduledFor": "ISO-timestamp",
      "status": "pending|processing|sent|failed",
      "attempts": 0,
      "created": "ISO-timestamp",
      "updated": "ISO-timestamp"
    }
  ],
  "settings": [
    {
      "key": "setting-key",
      "value": "setting-value",
      "description": "Setting description",
      "updated": "ISO-timestamp"
    }
