# Memory Leak Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Your WhatsApp Personal API application on Fly.io crashed due to memory exhaustion:
- **Allocated RAM**: 256MB (too low)
- **Virtual Memory**: 22GB (excessive, indicates swapping/thrashing)
- **Resident Memory**: 112MB (actual usage before crash)
- **Instance**: 48e46deb7ee548 (summer-rain-4241)

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

### 1. **Event Listener Memory Leak** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**File**: `src/services/whatsapp.ts`

**Problem**: WhatsApp Baileys event listeners were never cleaned up when the connection was restarted. Each disconnect/reconnect cycle added new listeners without removing old ones, causing memory to accumulate.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added event handler tracking with a Map
- Implemented `cleanupEventHandlers()` method to properly remove listeners
- Called cleanup before socket restart

### 2. **Insufficient Memory Allocation**
**File**: `fly.toml`

**Problem**: 256MB was too low for a WhatsApp client that maintains:
- WebSocket connection state
- Session authentication data
- Message buffers
- Cron jobs and scheduled messages

**Fix Applied**: Increased to 512MB

### 3. **No Node.js Memory Limit**
**File**: `Dockerfile`

**Problem**: Node.js could allocate unlimited memory, potentially causing swapping and system instability.

**Fix Applied**: Set `--max-old-space-size=384` (75% of 512MB, leaving headroom)

### 4. **Redis Connection Queue Buildup**
**Files**: `src/infra/redis.ts`, `src/services/recorders/redisRecorder.ts`, `src/services/recorders/redisInboundRecorder.ts`

**Problem**: When Redis was unavailable, ioredis would queue commands indefinitely, consuming memory.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Disabled offline queue (`enableOfflineQueue: false`)
- Added retry strategy (max 3 attempts)
- Limited retry backoff to 3 seconds

### 5. **No Memory Monitoring**
**File**: `src/server.ts`

**Problem**: No visibility into memory usage patterns.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `/health/memory` endpoint
- Implemented periodic memory logging (every 5 minutes)

- 📄 **FLY_MONITORING_COMMANDS.md** - Fly.io monitoring commands
- 📄 **MEMORY_LEAK_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy the Fixes
```bash
# Build and deploy
fly deploy

# Monitor deployment
fly logs
```

### 2. Monitor for 24-48 Hours
```bash
# Check memory usage via new endpoint
curl https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health/memory

# Stream logs
fly logs

# Watch for OOM kills
fly logs | grep -i "out of memory"
```

### 3. Verify Memory Stability
After 24 hours, memory should stabilize:
- **RSS**: 150-250 MB (should not grow continuously)
- **Heap Used**: 80-150 MB
- **No OOM kills**

### 4. Set Up Monitoring Alerts
- Configure Fly.io alerts for high memory usage (>80%)
- Use external monitoring for `/health` endpoint
- Monitor logs for restart events

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Frequent OOM kills
- ❌ Memory growing unbounded
- ❌ Event listeners accumulating
- ❌ No visibility into memory usage

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Stable memory usage
- ✅ No OOM kills
- ✅ Event listeners properly cleaned up
- ✅ Memory monitoring available
- ✅ Graceful handling of Redis failures

## 🔧 If Issues Persist

### If Still Experiencing OOM:

1. **Check Memory Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health/memory
   ```
   - If heap keeps growing: investigate message buffers
   - If external memory is high: check Baileys session data

2. **Increase Memory Further**:
   ```bash
   fly scale memory 1024
   ```

3. **Check Logs for Patterns**:
   ```bash
   fly logs --since "24h" | grep "memory_usage"
   ```

4. **Investigate Scheduled Messages**:
   - Check `/scheduled` endpoint
   - Look for excessive cron jobs
   - Review date-based scheduled messages

5. **Check Redis Status**:
   ```bash
   curl https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health/redis
   ```
   - If Redis is failing, it might cause retries

## 📈 Monitoring Tips

### Quick Health Check
```bash
# All-in-one health check
curl -s https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health | jq
curl -s https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health/memory | jq
curl -s https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health/redis | jq
```

### Memory Trend Analysis
```bash
# Log memory every 5 minutes
while true; do
  echo "$(date): $(curl -s https://whatsapp-personal-api.fly.dev/health/memory | jq -c)" >> memory_trend.log
  sleep 300
done

# Analyze trend (look for continuous growth)
cat memory_trend.log | grep heapUsed
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View memory logs from application
fly logs | grep "memory_usage"

# Count restarts
fly logs --since "7d" | grep -c "Server listening"

# Find crash patterns
fly logs --since "7d" | grep -i "error\|crash\|kill"
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Monitor these for 48 hours after deployment:

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| RSS Memory | 150-250 MB | >350 MB | >450 MB |
| Heap Used | 80-150 MB | >250 MB | >350 MB |
| OOM Kills | 0 | 1 | 2+ |
| Restarts/day | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4+ |
| Uptime | >95% | 90-95% | <90% |

## 🤝 Support

If memory issues continue after 48 hours with these fixes:
1. Gather logs and memory trends
2. Check for unusual patterns (high message volume, many scheduled tasks)
3. Consider profiling with Node.js heap snapshots
4. Open an issue with collected data

## ✨ Summary

The main issue was **event listener accumulation** in the WhatsApp client, combined with **insufficient memory allocation**. The fixes address:
- ✅ Event listener cleanup
- ✅ Increased memory (512MB)
- ✅ Node.js memory limits
- ✅ Redis queue management
- ✅ Memory monitoring

These changes should resolve the OOM kills. Monitor for 48 hours to confirm stability.
